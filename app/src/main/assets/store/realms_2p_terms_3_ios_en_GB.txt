You can manage the Realms subscription and turn off auto-renewal by accessing your Apple Account settings after purchase. There is also a button in-game that takes you to these settings. If you cancel after your subscription has activated, you won’t be refunded for the remaining active period of the subscription. Any unused portion of a free trial period will be forfeited when the user purchases a subscription.
